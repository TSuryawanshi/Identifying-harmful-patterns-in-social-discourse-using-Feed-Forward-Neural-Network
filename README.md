# Hate Speech Detection Model for CodeChef Weekend Challenge

Built an automated system to detect harmful discourse in social media text as part of a CodeChef Weekend Challenge.

Classified user-generated content into three distinct categories with a focus on distinguishing between "offensive language" and "hate speech" to reduce false positives in moderation.

Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning, resulting in a 9.5 accuracy rate on unseen test data.

Processed a dataset of 10,000 records, demonstrating ability to handle and clean large-scale unstructured text data.
